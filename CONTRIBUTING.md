#SSECR Contributing Guidelines
##Editing Course Materials
There are three options for editing the course materials:

Send materials to Nick Lyon for integration into the website
Work directly in GitHub
only available if the page(s) you're editing do not have code chunks
Connect GitHub to your preferred code software (e.g., RStudio, VS Code, etc.) and push local changes to GitHub
##Avoiding Conflicts
If either option 2 or 3 sounds like a good fit for you, we need to be careful we do not cause merge conflicts! Please make a post in the #lter-grad-course channel of the NCEAS Slack organization for both when you start working on the website and when you're finished.

If you're working in a developer environment (i.e., option 3 above), please pull regularly so that you are editing the most up-to-date materials.

At this point, we are not using GitHub branches and/or forks so please just work directly in the 'main' branch.

##Accessing Course Materials
###GitHub
We are using a GitHub Team (see here for more information on GitHub Teams) to simplify access protocols to SSECR GitHub materials.
